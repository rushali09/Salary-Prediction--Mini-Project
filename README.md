# Salary-Prediction--Mini-Project

In this project, I have learnt on how to predict employee salary based on multiple variables like experience, test_score and interview_score using linear regression model. I have attached the code and dataset in this repository for references. This mini-project is a part of my Machine learning journey to help me understand the basics and implement my knowledge at the same time.
